# EcoSeed
Every plant needs a someone to keep an eye on it. Or maybe something? EcoSeed is a eco friendly system that takes good care of your plant and notifies you about its growth progress.

# Main Idea
Our idea is a system that will monitor a plant (its height, weight and soil) and also rotate it to a specific position where the amount of light is as much as possible. After that, we collect these information and upload them in a PHP database. To do this, we needed to learn some new things about the components that we used and also the way we wanted them to work.
# Functionality
The **Ecoseed** system consists of two parts. The first is the Esp32 with its accessories which sends the collected data to the second part which is the server which in turn, displays the data on a web application.
